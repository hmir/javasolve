# javasolve
javasolve is a quick way of simplifying mathmatical expressions in java. For example:

``` 
Expression.solve("5^2 * 2 + sin(24)"); //returns 50.0
```
Currently, javasolve supports the ```sin```, ```cos```, ```tan```, ```asin```, ```acos```, ```atan```, ```csc```, ```sec```, ```cot```, ```sqrt```, ```ln```, and ```log10``` functions, but new functions can be easily added to the Functions class.
